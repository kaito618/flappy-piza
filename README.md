i'm done with the walls and the world scenes and linked them tgth 
added the reseter as this whole game is just based on visual illusions u think that the bird is flying to the right side of the screen and dodging the walls but what actually happening that the bird is just falling on the y axis and the x axis doen't change at all and the walls are the moving parts as they move from right to left and then when they get out of the screen they touch an eara that sends a signal to delete the wall and respawn it in the same place as the beginning with random y axis from a specific range so for my game i used only 5 walls but it will show as that infinite number of walls are on the right of the screen and that the bird flying towards them lol
