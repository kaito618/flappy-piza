i alr got the setup ready to work on days ago , now i just added the player and coded the plater part for now , it does fall when u start the game and speed go up to 200 and then get capped and the flap is space w up arrow left click and makes the player go up by 200 
done player at 12:1 am

i'm done with the walls and the world scenes and linked them tgth 
added the reseter as this whole game is just based on visual illusions u think that the bird is flying to the right side of the screen and dodging the walls but what actually happening that the bird is just falling on the y axis and the x axis doen't change at all and the walls are the moving parts as they move from right to left and then when they get out of the screen they touch an eara that sends a signal to delete the wall and respawn it in the same place as the beginning with random y axis from a specific range so for my game i used only 5 walls but it will show as that infinite number of walls are on the right of the screen and that the bird flying towards them lol

i added the points sys had some problems with getting it to actually work to find out that i misspelled the area name omd 
and then i added the "dying" part so now when the player toutches the walls the game resets and that's for now that's the base of the game and i'll start adjusting andd adding other features on the next session see ya all next time
